A responsive single page application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and React/Redux for the frontend, [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for
the backend API. <br>
I used [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to implement reusable components which are used across the application, and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for
CSS styles. <br>
Also, I used Jest for unit tests, and [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for testing Storybook Components.
